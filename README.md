# Linux Kernel Modules Tutorial
- - - -
- - - -
I've decided to write a different kind of tutorial on LKMs. There's a lot of tutorials online, but since this is a really complex topic one more cannot really hurt.
It's mostly meant to __complement__ other HowTos you can find online.
I'm familiarizing myself completely with the topic as well so don't mind if I fail to explain some things.

Be sure to check the links I listed in the 'Other' directory.
